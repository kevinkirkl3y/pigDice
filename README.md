# Pig Dice

#### _Object and Looping Practice for Epicodus 11.4.2020_

#### by Nataliya Zhuravleva, Tawnee Harris, Kevin Kirkley

## Description
This was a practice in creating objects and using loops that took the form of a competitive two-player dice game. The goal of the game is to reach 100 using a "Die" object that creates a random number between 1-6. This program takes the values generated by the die to calculate a users score both for their turn as well as their total score. If a roll of 1 is generated it will end the users turn and reduce their turn score to 0 and switch players turn. When a score >= 100 is reached a card will appear noting the winner of the game. This program is still a work in progress, the player turn actions still need to be hashed out.
